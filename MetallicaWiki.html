                Metallica was formed by Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield in October
                1981. Ulrich (who originally went to the US from Denmark to play
                tennis) had, during that summer, met Brian Slagel of Metal Blade
                Records and secured an appearance on an upcoming compilation called
                Metal Massacre, but had no band. He quickly found Hetfield, who was
                playing in Leather Charm at the time, and one day in December of 1981,
                they recorded the rhythm tracks to a remake of a Leather Charm song,
                "Hit the Lights". Hetfield tracked all guitars and bass on this
                recording, except for one of the solos, which was performed by
                guitarist Lloyd Grant in January 1982, and the song appeared on the
                Metal Massacre compilation that was released on June 14th, 1982.
                Permanent guitarist Dave Mustaine (Megadeth) was brought in during
                February 1982, and a bassist, Ron McGovney, was found. Ron was James'
                roommate, and James taught him to play bass so that the band could
                play live. This line-up re-recorded "Hit the Lights" for the second
                pressing of Metal Massacre. The first live show was on March 14th at
                Radio City Music Hall in Anaheim. James did only vocals, and Dave was
                the single guitarist. The band at this point had several rehearsal
                tapes floating about, but then in response to one of those being
                pressed to vinyl by Bongus Loadus Records, decided to record their
                first demo, with the Grant version of Hit the Lights and two covers.
                This demo was first given out at the March 27th, 1982 gig at the
                Whisky, when they opened for Saxon. A vocalist named Sammy DeJohn, of
                the band Ruthless, was in for a few rehearsals, but no actual gigs.
                Two more studio demos were recorded in 1982, one in April and one in
                July. On April 23rd, 1982, guitarist Damian C. Phillips played one
                gig, before quitting, because Dave wouldn't let him do dueling leads.
                James took over as the second guitarist live from then on. Extensive
                live gigging occurred, including one show at Lars' high school on May
                25th at which the final attendance was zero. On May 28th, Jeff Warner
                was on vocals, but this show seems to have been a glorified rehearsal.
                He sang only that one gig. Also, Tygers of Pan Tang vocalist Jess Cox
                was considered, but he did not accept. A live demo was recorded on
                November 29th, 1982 on a road trip to San Francisco. This road trip
                would prove useful, as the opener for Metallica on November 29th was a
                band called Exodus with Kirk Hammett on guitar. Also, Metallica
                attended a Trauma gig, with Cliff Burton on bass, and immediately
                tried to convince Cliff to join Metallica. Cliff was convinced to
                join, on the condition that Metallica moves to San Francisco. Cliff's
                first gig was on March 5th, 1983. Ron McGovney was later seen in
                Phantasm. Problems between Dave Mustaine and the rest of the band
                arose in late March on a road trip to the east coast. Dave was given a
                bus ticket back home and unceremoniously released, while Kirk Hammett
                flew in and the band did not miss a gig. At this time, the band stayed
                with Anthrax, and from what the band has said, it was very tough
                living, as all of their limited funds were invested into the band.

                The first album, Kill 'Em All, was recorded for Megaforce Records in
                the summer of 1983, and after some touring, they cut a four-song demo
                in October. James Hetfield became the vocalist out of necessity and
                had considered finding a replacement so he could be a full-time rhythm
                guitar player. They contemplated asking vocalist John Bush, vocalist
                of Armored Saint and later to be the vocalist of Anthrax, to join but
                he declined, deciding to stay with "his buddies band." In the end,
                Hetfield decided to take over vocals once and for all. The second
                album, Ride the Lightning, came out in the spring of 1984, featuring
                riffs from Dave Mustaine and also Tom Hunting via Kirk Hammett. Work
                on a third album began in the summer of 1985, and the album, Master of
                Puppets, was released in the spring of 1986. As an early parody of the
                PMRC's "explicit lyrics" warning labels, many prints of Metallica's
                '86 release of Master of Puppets featured an octagonal sticker on the
                front stating: "The only track you probably won't want to play is
                Damage, Inc. due to the multiple uses of the infamous "F" word.
                Otherwise, there aren't any Shits, Fucks, Pisses, Cunts,
                Motherfuckers, or Cocksuckers anywhere on this record". When James
                Hetfield broke his arm in a skateboarding accident in July 1986, six
                weeks of gigs featured roadie John Marshall on rhythm guitar (he would
                later join Metal Church). On September 25th, James was back. One more
                gig was played on the 26th, and then on the morning of the 27th, their
                tour bus hit a patch of black ice and flipped over, killing bassist
                Cliff Burton. The band decided to continue and began searching for a
                new bassist. Among those that tried out was Kirk Hammett's friend,
                bass legend Les Claypool (Blind Illusion, Primus), who was rejected,
                because he played too well. In the end, Flotsam and Jetsam bassist
                Jason Newsted was brought in in November, being officially sworn in at
                a restaurant in Phoenix called Tommy's Joint. The ...and Justice for
                All album was recorded in 1988, with a serious lack of bass presence,
                and then a world tour followed in 1989. In 1989, Metallica was
                nominated for a Grammy in "Best Heavy Metal Performance of the Year"
                alongside AC/DC, Iggy Pop, and Jethro Tull. Everybody was expecting
                Metallica to take the award, but, surprisingly, the award went to
                Jethro Tull, who did not even play metal or anything resembling it.

                In 1991, the fifth Metallica album was released and this time they had
                a new producer. Flemming Rasmussen, who had produced the previous 3
                albums was out, and the new producer was Bob Rock. The new album was
                self-titled had a much more commercial feel to it and sold 30 million
                copies worldwide. And this time, justice took place as Metallica
                received a Grammy award for "Best Heavy Metal Performance of the
                Year". When they received it, Lars Ulrich said: "We wanna thank Jethro
                Tull for not putting out an album this year." After extensive touring
                over the next four years, Metallica returned to the studio in May 1995
                and recorded the album Load. The album was less metal-orientated and
                more laid back, and it still divides fans to this day. The follow-up
                to Load, Reload, was released in 1997 and consisted of outtakes from
                Load. The next album was released only a year later. Garage Inc. was a
                collection of B-Sides and the long out-of-print "Garage Days
                Re-Revisited" EP, along with a second disc consisting of brand new
                covers of songs from bands such as Mercyful Fate, Misfits, Nick Cave &
                the Bad Seeds, and Lynyrd Skynyrd, among others. After a year of
                touring, the next Metallica project was entitled "S&M", a
                collaboration of sorts with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. This
                consisted of two live shows, with Metallica playing some of their
                songs with a full Orchestral Backing. "S&M" was released on cassette,
                CD, VHS, and DVD formats in November 1999. Metallica then won a grammy
                for "Rock Instrumental Performance" with "The Call of the Ktulu" taken
                from the "S&M" album.

                The next few years would see a lot of upheaval within Metallica. In
                2000 Metallica sued the file-sharing service Napster, with the claim
                that Napster "encourages and enables visitors to its website to
                unlawfully exchange with others copyrighted songs and sound recordings
                without the knowledge or permission of Metallica." This move, while
                ultimately successful, alienated a significant portion of Metallica's
                fans. Next, in January 2001, Jason Newstead, who had been Metallica's
                bassist for 14 years, quit "due to private and personal reasons, and
                the physical damage that [he had] done to [him]self over the years."
                This was followed by James going to rehab in July 2001. Over the next
                few years Metallica was quite close to splitting up, as was documented
                in their DVD Some Kind of Monster. However, they managed to overcome
                their differences, and by July 2003, they had Robert Trujillo as their
                new bassist and had released their eighth studio album, St. Anger. On
                April 4th, 2009 Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of
                Fame. On November 30th, 2012, Metallica launched their own label,
                Blackened Recordings, and took ownership of all of their master
                recordings from the Warner Music Group. In late 2013, the band won a
                Guinness world record for playing in all continents (Antarctica
                included) in less than one year. They played a (not so) secret gig at
                their own Orion music festival, on June 8th, 2013, performing their
                debut, Kill 'Em All, under the name Dehaan. That's the name of the
                main actor in their Through the Never movie of the same year. In 2017
                they performed "Moth into Flame" at Grammy Awards in collaboration
                with Lady Gaga as second lead vocalist, but never released this
                version of the song outside the YouTube video of the live performance.
